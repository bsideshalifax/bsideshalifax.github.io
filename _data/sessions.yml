  description: "SolarMarker is a malware family consisting of multiple states, an installer, a backdoor, and an information stealer module. SolarMarker uses a variety of loaders to execute SoalrMarker Backdoor. In this presentation we will be analyzing various SolarMarker loaders featuring one in Golang, then destroying SolarMarker Backdoor to the point we can compile it in our own Visual Studio project and identify C2 servers before they are used in the wild. Throughout this presentation there will be tips for hunting and detection."

  title: "Re-imagining Security & Testing in the era of Digital Transformation"
  description: "Today there is almost no business that can operate without computers. All computers operate using software in the form of operating systems, applications, and the internet. Hence, we can say that computers are quintessential to the entire supply chain. On the downside, it is well-known that nearly all software contains loopholes of some type on some level. There are numerous hostile actors who expend huge efforts to look for such flaws & exploit those to their advantage. This results in major data breaches & hacks costing money & reputation to the company. The rate at which these cybersecurity breaches are increasing is brutal. With recent high-profile attacks targeting healthcare, finance, government, retail, energy, & manufacturing, it is evident that the threat landscape is expanding significantly every day. With such attacks making frequent headlines, security is on top of mind for every organization. Then, why when it comes to software development, security & testing is still an afterthought? In this presentation, we will look at it’s possible root causes and the measures that can be adopted by companies to challenge the status-quo to build a ‘safer tomorrow’. "

  title: "Every Minute Matters: Proving the Value of Cybersecurity Awareness Programs"
  description: Even with record spending on cybersecurity in 2022, by any measure, the results were far from ideal. From the breach of a global digital identity provider using persistent social engineering that defeated multi-factor authentication, to devastating attacks on healthcare organizations that resulted in the loss of highly sensitive personal medical information of millions of people held for ransom, it was a bad year.</br></br>Criminals know people are the key to cybersecurity. From cloud infrastructure that is improperly architected, to the loss of physical hard drives with sensitive data, to the continued mass-success of phishing attacks, human factors are at the centre of almost every successful attack. Far from being the weakest link in the chain, with the targeted investments in cyber awareness they can become your biggest line of defence in the first critical minutes of an attack.</br></br>But for cyber awareness programs to have a chance at succeeding in this ever-growing threat landscape, we need to achieve buy-in across organizations. People need to feel that their time is valued and every minute they are being asked to give up will be used effectively. And in an uncertain economy leaders are being held to account for every dollar they spend, so we need to prove the value of our programs more than ever before</br></br>Devin Patterson leads the Customer Success Team at Fredericton-based Beauceron Security. Through our work with nearly 700 customers including some of Canada's largest household brands, he and his team have developed insights and reports to help security awareness program leads measure success, identify areas of future opportunity and prove return on investment."

  title: "Microsegmentation vs Malware Proliferation"
  description: "In networks today it is generally not if but when malware is going to be downloaded to a host. We will discuss how this malware then moves around inside a legacy network and how microsegmenting a network can be used to help limit the east west proliferation. "

  title: "GitHub Actions 101 - Creating a DevSecOps Pipeline"
  description: "More organizations are applying a DevOps methodology to optimize software development. One of the main tools used in this process is a continuous integration (CI) tool that automates code changes from multiple developers working on the same project. In 2019, GitHub released its own CI tool called GitHub Actions. According to GitHub, GitHub Actions help you automate tasks within your software development life cycle, and it has been gaining a lot of adoption from developers. </br></br>This talk will demonstrate how GitHub Actions work and show security tools to protect your applications from attackers. First, we’ll dive deeply into the Actions, the language, and the runners, the servers provided by GitHub to run your Actions. Then, we’ll show how to run SAST, DAST, and SCA using open source or free tools into your pipeline just using GitHub Actions. We’ll set up Actions for each tool to scan our application for security vulnerabilities at every pull request."
